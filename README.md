## Statement of Problem:
Given a maze with (distinct) path(s), what is the boolean value of the statement “it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure”?

## Recursive Abstraction
When I am asked to find the boolean value of the statement
“it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure?”,
The recursive abstraction can find the boolean value of the statement
“it is possible to get from the starting position to treasure?”,
starting with the next step in a cardinal direction.

## Base Cases
If the current step has a treasure (when the explorer is on the treasure),
then the statement in the problem has a boolean value of true.

If the explorer is on the wall, 
then the statement in the problem has a boolean value of false.

## English or Pseudocode Description of Algorithm

When I am asked for the solution to a maze problem,
the Recursive Abstraction can provide the boolean value of the statement in the problem, starting with the next step in a cardinal direction.

Base Case - (If base case isn’t prompted after travelling all possible (distinct) path(s), then the statement in the problem has a boolean value of false)
If I am on a treasure,
then the statement in the problem has a boolean value of true.
